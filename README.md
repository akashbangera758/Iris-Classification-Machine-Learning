# Iris-Classification-Machine-Learning
Iris Flower dataset is used here for classification using scikit learn Supervised learning models and Tensorflow.

In iris_sklearn.py, the machine learning models used by me were Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, KNeighbours Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

In iris_tensorflow.py, the program trains a Deep Neural Network Classifier for the classification of Iris flower.
