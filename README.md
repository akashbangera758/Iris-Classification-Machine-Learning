# Iris-Classification-Machine-Learning
Iris Flower dataset is used here for classification using scikit learn Supervised learning models.
The machine learning models used by me in this project were Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, KNeighbours Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.
